## Project setup

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Running With Live Data (API)

Please find the Score API in my Repo.  Use this to run the API.  API will be needed to set to the right port.  In this case the app is looking for port 3001.  If you use another port, change the Store.js in the Stores folder.
